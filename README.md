# AI Movie Recommendation Engine

Project that finds most similar movies for a selected movie using MovieLens dataset (100k/1 million).

I did this by implementing Collaborative Filtering which is entirely based on the past behavior and not on the context. More specifically, it is based on the similarity in preferences, tastes and choices of two users. It analyses how similar the tastes of one user is to another and makes recommendations on the basis of that.
I used Cosine Similarity as my distance similarity metric (similarity is the cosine of the angle between the 2 vectors of the item vectors of A and B. Closer the vectors, smaller will be the angle and larger the cosine).

***This project was made for a subject at university called "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence"***
